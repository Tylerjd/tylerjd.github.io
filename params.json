{"name":"Tylerjd","tagline":"About the Coding Me","body":"## Tyler Doherty\r\nHi! I am a High School student who specializes in Linux Systems administration, and likes to dabble in coding. I have a few projects here on GitHub for those interested. Sadly, I don't  have much time to care for them and some have even been abandoned as I move on to other languages.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\n\r\nI currently have a love-hate relationship with PHP, enjoy Ruby a lot, and am learning JS for usage in Node. I have dabbled a bit in Java and Python, with a touch of C++, but most of the languages that I use daily are for web development, not so much local applications. I am up-to-date when it comes to HTML5 and CSS3, but those really aren't considered programming languages, more just markup. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\n### RubyMinecraft\r\nRubyMinecraft is a Ruby Gem with the sole purpose of providing an easy to use layer between Minecraft server's RCON and Query ports and Ruby. Originally a fork of another gem, it has grown to be its own beast. It needs some love and attention, with a few things in the pipes for it as far as updates go. \r\n\r\n### CloudySunshine\r\nCloudySunshine is a currently-just-a-concept Android application that pulls the top rated wallpaper off of the two subreddits, r/wallpaper and r/wallpapers and puts it as the wallpaper on your Android 4.0+ device. I still need to sharpen up on my Java and Android libraries before I can get a build off for that. \r\n\r\n_There are some other projects, they just have not been documented yet :/_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
